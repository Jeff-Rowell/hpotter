HPotter is a Golang honney pot implementation. It works by creating disposible container images upon each connection to the pot. The associated payloads sent to the honeypot are optionally stored to a local database for further inspection and analysis. Additionally, the honey pot is configurable to run multiple services and protocols by specifying container images in a `config.json` file.
